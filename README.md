With so many different companies, organizations and governments developing within this space; there needs be unifying standards to tie it all together.  From Identity to Tax Code to Regulation or the Protocols powering and connecting platforms.......We are there.

Stay tuned as we populate this repository with the most compelling advances in Tax, Identity and Standards as these areas evolve!
