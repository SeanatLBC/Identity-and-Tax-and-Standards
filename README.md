# Identity-and-Tax-and-Standards
With so many different companies, organizations and governments developing within this space; there needs be unifying standards to tie it all together.  From Identity to Tax Code to Regulation or the Protocols powering and connecting platforms.......We are there.

As you can see....this area is a little lite so far :-)  This is not due to lack of information, but rather, a desire to only provide the information which is going to be a part of the larger foundation.  Stay tuned as we populate this repository with the most compelling advances in Tax, Identity and Standards as these areas evolve!
